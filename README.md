        <p>Digital worlds are great vectors of emotions. They produce original and immersive worlds, allowing unique playful experiences.<br>
        The creation of these is all the more impressive, and this is what makes me want to share and make discover these worlds in my turn.</p>
        <p>Having a logical mind, I decided to make programming my vocation. I am interested in the evolution of the environment and I explore its possibilities. From the design of physical and rendering engines, to ergonomic methods of user interfaces.</p>
        <p>Yet, this path is a really complicated one, especially in our time. So I keep myself interested and invested in various development subjects.</p>
