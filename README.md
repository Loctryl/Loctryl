    <h2>🔖 About me :</h2>
      <p>🌍 French - July 2003</p>

      <p>📍 Les Sables d'Olonne, France</p>

      <p>Digital worlds are great vectors of emotions. They produce original and immersive worlds, allowing unique playful experiences.<br>
      The creation of these is all the more impressive, and this is what makes me want to share and make discover these worlds in my turn.</p>
      <p>Having a logical mind, I decided to make programming my vocation. I am interested in the evolution of the environment and I explore its possibilities. From the design of physical and rendering engines, to ergonomic methods of user interfaces.</p>
      <p>Yet, this path is a really complicated one, especially in our time. So I keep myself interested and invested in various development subjects.</p>
